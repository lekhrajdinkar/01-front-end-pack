## intro

- language plus compiler to transcompile
- has no runtime

## Adv of TS:

- Class, interface, generic, Access specifies
- Add type in function arg, return type.
- obj1.proNotExist = "someValue" // cannot do in TS
- prevents hetrogeneous array, has another type Tuple. Also Enum.
- adds additinal feature to evoling ES6+ (access specifier, interface, generics, enums) syntax wise by using JS workarounds. JS might have complex snippets to perform same task.
- Strong typing - Make JS from Dynamic type to static type
- Catch lots of error at compile time, makes JS robust, can write better code.
